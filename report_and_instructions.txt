## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Architectural Misalignment**
- **Database Complexity**: The MongoDB-like wrapper over D1 creates unnecessary abstraction
- **Authentication Chaos**: Three different auth methods (Telegram, JWT, cookies) without clear hierarchy
- **Storage Strategy**: Using Telegram channels as a CDN is unreliable and doesn't scale
- **API Structure**: Inconsistent routing and error handling throughout

### 2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Predictable Tickets**: The hex-based ticket system can be brute-forced
- **No Rate Limiting**: APIs are vulnerable to abuse
- **File Access Control**: Once a file_id is obtained, it's accessible forever
- **CORS Too Permissive**: Allows any origin to access the API

### 3. **UI/UX Deficiencies**
- **Basic Design**: Current UI lacks the polish and features of modern streaming platforms
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Basic bottom navigation doesn't match user expectations
- **No Advanced Features**: Missing search, filters, continue watching, recommendations
- **Loading States**: Simple spinners instead of skeleton screens

### 4. **Telegram Integration Confusion**
- **Role Overlap**: Bot and channel responsibilities are unclear
- **Complex State Machine**: The conversation flow is overly complicated
- **Storage Limitations**: Telegram's file size limits (2GB) restrict content quality






## You will follow this Comprehensive Improvement Plan while maintaining this project completly free, each task you finish you will tell me what you did and ask for permission to continue with the plan


Phase 1: Architecture Redesign
1.1 Clarify Component Roles
Telegram Bot Purpose:

Primary Role: Content ingestion & management interface

Responsibilities:

Add new titles to the database

Upload content files

Manage metadata

Admin notifications

What it should NOT do:

User authentication

Direct content streaming

Complex conversation flows

Telegram Channel Purpose:

Primary Role: Backup storage only

Responsibilities:

Store original files as backup

Provide file IDs for initial processing

Migration Plan: Eventually move to a free-tier CDN or self-hosted object store (e.g. local file server)

Web App Purpose:

Primary Role: User-facing streaming platform

Responsibilities:

Content browsing & discovery

Video playback

User profiles & preferences

Social features (ratings, lists)

1.2 Database Simplification
Remove MongoDB Wrapper

Write native D1 (SQLite-compatible) SQL queries

Use prepared statements

Implement connection pooling in-app

Add proper indexes for performance

Schema Improvements

Edit
-- foreign keys, full-text search indexes,
-- materialized views (via manual refresh tables),
-- audit tables for tracking changes
1.3 Authentication Strategy
Single Auth Flow

Primary: JWT-based auth for web (tokens stored in http-only cookies)

Secondary: Telegram auth only for bot admins

Session Management: In-memory or D1 table for refresh tokens (no external KV)

Token Rotation: Issue short-lived JWT + rotating refresh tokens

Phase 2: Security Hardening
2.1 Ticket System Overhaul
New Secure Ticket System

Use cryptographically secure UUIDs

Implement time-based HMAC tokens

Add IP-based checks

Create ticket revocation list in D1

Enforce one-time or time-limited use

2.2 API Security
Rate Limiting (self-hosted)

Implement sliding-window or token-bucket in-app

Per-IP and per-user quotas

Endpoint-specific thresholds

Simple abuse-detection flags in database

Access Control

Proper RBAC (roles stored in D1)

Optional content encryption using local keys

Audit logs in D1

Geo-blocking via IP lookup library

Phase 3: UI/UX Transformation
3.1 Netflix-Inspired Design System
Tech Stack: Next.js + Tailwind CSS (all free)

Core Components:

Hero Carousel

Auto-play trailers (hosted on free tier)

Gradient overlays

Dynamic content based on history

Smooth transitions with Framer Motion

Content Rows

Lazy-loaded horizontal scroll

Hover previews (mini-trailers preloaded)

Category organization

“Because you watched X” (client-side logic)

Video Player

Custom controls (HTML5)

Skip intro/outro buttons

Multi-language subtitles

Adaptive bitrate via plain HLS segments

Picture-in-picture (native browser)

Navigation

Transparent, shrink-on-scroll header

Search with client-side filtering + server full-text search

Profile switcher

Notification icon (in-app)

Mobile-First Design:

Bottom sheet nav (no paid libs)

Gesture controls via pointer events

Offline mode via Service Worker + IndexedDB

Vertical video support for user-uploaded mobile clips

3.2 Advanced Features
Personalization Engine (self-hosted)

Track history client- and server-side

Simple collaborative filtering in-app

Custom categories per user

Continue watching via DB pointers

Social Features

Watch parties via WebSockets (nodejs)

Reviews & ratings in D1

Shareable lists (public URLs)

Comments with simple moderation flags

Phase 4: Storage & CDN Strategy
4.1 Move Away from Telegram Storage
Implement Free-Tier CDN

Host static assets on Cloudflare Pages (free)

Use Cloudflare Workers KV for small metadata (free tier)

Transcode on-the-fly with open-source FFMPEG on your own server

Edge caching via Cloudflare (free)

Migration Process

Download content from Telegram

Self-host FFMPEG to generate multi-bitrate HLS segments

Upload segments to Pages or static bucket

Update DB references

Fallback to Telegram if edge cache misses

4.2 Content Delivery Optimization
Streaming Pipeline

Pre-signed URLs with simple expiry logic in-app

Chunked transfer (HLS)

Bandwidth detection via JS probing

Seamless quality switching

Preload next segment/episode in background

Phase 5: Telegram Bot Simplification
5.1 Streamlined Bot Commands

/add_movie   – Start movie add workflow  
/add_show    – Start show add workflow
